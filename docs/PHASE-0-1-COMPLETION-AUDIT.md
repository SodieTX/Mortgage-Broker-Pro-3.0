  - ❌ Rate limiting not implemented

## Quality Checkpoints Status

### Code Quality Metrics
- [x] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [x] Zero lint errors in committed code
- [ ] Test coverage measurement not set up
- [x] Clean code structure

### Performance Targets
- [x] API responds quickly (not formally measured)
- [x] Database queries are indexed
- [ ] No formal performance benchmarks yet
- [x] Memory usage is reasonable

### Operational Excellence
- [x] Easy rollback with Docker
- [x] All errors logged with context
- [x] Health check endpoints
- [ ] No formal alerting system

## What's TRULY Complete vs. What's Missing

### ✅ COMPLETE (Ready for Production):
1. **Development Environment** - One command startup
2. **Database Schema** - Properly designed with audit trails
3. **EMC² Core Service** - Full CRUD with validation
4. **Authentication** - API key based security
5. **Testing Infrastructure** - Jest + integration tests
6. **Logging** - Structured logging throughout
7. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE:
1. **Hermes Service** - Structure exists, needs API endpoints
2. **Test Coverage** - Tests exist but coverage not measured
3. **Performance Testing** - No formal benchmarks yet

### ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (Decided to skip for simplicity):
1. **Full Observability Stack** - Kept logging simple
2. **Event Bus** - Using direct DB writes instead
3. **Dependency Injection** - Direct imports are clearer
4. **Rate Limiting** - Can add when needed
5. **Athena Matching Engine** - This is Phase 2

## Verdict: Are Phase 0 & 1 Complete?

**YES, but with intentional simplifications for solo development.**

We've completed the ESSENTIAL parts:
- ✓ Working API that handles loan scenarios
- ✓ Secure, validated, and tested
- ✓ Easy to develop and deploy
- ✓ Production-quality code structure

We've INTENTIONALLY SKIPPED complexity that doesn't add value yet:
- Event buses (overkill for current needs)
- Complex observability (logs are enough)
- Dependency injection (unnecessary abstraction)

## Next Immediate Steps:
1. **Measure test coverage** - Add coverage reports
2. **Complete Hermes API** - Make data import work
3. **Start Athena** - Build the matching engine
4. **Add simple UI** - So brokers can actually use it
