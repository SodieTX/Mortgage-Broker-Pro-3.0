# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2024-01-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. 

Mortgage Broker Pro 3.0 is a complex system with many moving parts, integrations, and business rules. As a solo developer project that may eventually grow to include more team members, it's crucial to document why certain technical decisions were made. This will help:

- Future developers (including myself) understand the reasoning behind decisions
- Avoid relitigating past decisions
- Provide context for when decisions should be revisited
- Maintain consistency across the codebase

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as described by Michael Nygard, to record significant architectural decisions.

ADRs will:
- Be stored in `docs/adr/`
- Be numbered sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
- Follow the standard ADR template
- Be written in Markdown for easy version control
- Include status tracking (proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded)

## Consequences

### Positive

- Creates a decision log for the project
- Provides context for future changes
- Helps onboard new developers
- Documents trade-offs and constraints
- Improves project transparency

### Negative

- Requires discipline to maintain
- Adds overhead to decision-making process
- May slow down rapid prototyping phases

### Neutral

- Becomes part of the project documentation
- Requires periodic review to ensure relevance
