# Mortgage Broker Pro 3.0 - Phase 0 & Phase 1 Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to building a solid foundation for Mortgage Broker Pro 3.0, emphasizing quality, performance, and craftsmanship at every step.

## Core Principles
1. **Quality Over Speed**: Every line of code should be purposeful and well-tested
2. **Performance by Design**: Architecture decisions that scale from day one
3. **Craftsmanship**: Clean, maintainable code that's a joy to work with
4. **Incremental Progress**: Small, validated steps toward the larger vision

## Phase 0: Foundation & Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1: Development Environment Excellence

  - Database with proper seeding scripts
  - Local observability stack (Grafana, Prometheus, Jaeger)
- [ ] Establish coding standards
  - TypeScript/Node.js style guide
  - SQL formatting standards
  - Git commit conventions
- [ ] Create development tooling
  - Pre-commit hooks for linting
  - Automated formatting
  - Type checking

### Week 2: Database Foundation
- [ ] Initialize core database with proper versioning
  - Set up Flyway or similar migration tool
  - Create baseline schema from enhanced versions

- [ ] Performance baseline
  - Create performance testing framework
  - Establish query performance benchmarks
  - Set up slow query logging
- [ ] Data integrity
  - Comprehensive foreign key constraints
  - Check constraints for business rules
  - Trigger-based audit logging

### Week 3: Core Service Architecture

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Weeks 5-12)

### Week 5-6: EMC² Core Service Implementation
- [ ] Scenario lifecycle management
  ```typescript
  // Clean, testable service layer
  class ScenarioService {
    async createScenario(data: CreateScenarioDTO): Promise<Scenario> {
      // Validation
      // Business logic
      // Event publishing
      // Return result
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Event publishing with proper typing
- [ ] State machine implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

### Week 7-8: Hermes Data Service
- [ ] Data ingestion API
  - Multiple format support (JSON, CSV, XML)
  - Streaming for large files
  - Progress tracking
- [ ] Validation engine
  - Schema validation
  - Business rule validation
  - Quality scoring algorithm
- [ ] Transformation pipeline
  - Pluggable transformers
  - Error recovery
  - Transformation audit trail

### Week 9-10: Athena Matching Engine
- [ ] Core matching algorithm
  - Efficient query building
  - Caching strategy
  - Result ranking
- [ ] Scoring system
  - Pluggable scoring modules
  - Explanation generation
  - A/B testing framework
- [ ] Performance optimization
  - Query optimization
  - Result caching
  - Connection pooling

### Week 11-12: Integration & Polish
- [ ] End-to-end workflows
  - Complete scenario flow testing
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Load testing
- [ ] Documentation
  - API documentation with examples
  - Architecture decision records
  - Runbooks for common issues
- [ ] Security hardening
  - Input validation everywhere
  - SQL injection prevention
  - Rate limiting
  - Authentication/Authorization setup

## Quality Checkpoints

### Code Quality Metrics
- Test coverage: >90% for business logic, >80% overall
- Cyclomatic complexity: <10 for all functions
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Zero lint warnings
- All TODOs tracked in issues

### Performance Targets
- API response time: <100ms for 95th percentile
- Database queries: <50ms for 99th percentile
- Event processing: <1s end-to-end
- Memory usage: <512MB per service instance

### Operational Excellence
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Rollback capability <5 minutes
- All errors logged with context
- Alerts for anomalies
- Runbooks for all alerts

## Technical Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 LTS with TypeScript 5
- **Framework**: Fastify for performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with proper extensions
- **Events**: RabbitMQ for reliability
- **Cache**: Redis for session/cache
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry

### Architecture Patterns
- **Services**: Hexagonal architecture
- **Database**: Repository pattern
- **Events**: Event sourcing where appropriate
- **API**: RESTful with OpenAPI specs
- **Testing**: Test pyramid approach

### Development Practices
- **Version Control**: Git flow with PR reviews
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with quality gates
- **Documentation**: Inline code docs + ADRs
- **Dependencies**: Renovate for updates
- **Security**: Dependabot + SAST scanning

## Success Criteria

### Phase 0 Complete When:
- [ ] All developers can spin up full environment in <5 minutes
- [ ] Database migrations run automatically
- [ ] All services have health checks
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard shows all metrics
- [ ] First integration test passes

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] Complete loan scenario can be created and evaluated
- [ ] All services communicate via events
- [ ] Performance targets are met
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] System handles 100 concurrent users

## Next Steps

After Phase 1:
