# EMC2-Core Build Checklist

## Current Status ✓
- [x] TypeScript compilation working
- [x] Email service circular dependencies resolved
- [x] Service initialization architecture implemented
- [x] All tests passing (29 tests, 0 failing) ✅
- [x] Observability stack implemented (OpenTelemetry) 🔭

## Major Boulders Completed 🏯

### Observability Stack ✅
**What we built:**
- OpenTelemetry SDK integration
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Metrics collection with Prometheus
- Correlation ID propagation
- Enhanced logging with trace context
- Docker Compose for local stack
- Decorators for easy instrumentation
- Business metrics tracking

**Why it matters:**
- Can debug production issues across services
- Performance bottlenecks are visible
- Error correlation is automatic
- Ready for microservices architecture

## Critical Issues to Fix (In Order)

### 1. ~~Fix Failing Test~~ ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `src/services/authService.test.ts`
**Issue**: ~~Test failing due to email service initialization~~
**Resolution**: Fixed mock to use new email wrapper

### 2. ~~Environment Configuration~~ 🔧 COMPLETED
**Created**:
- [x] `.env.development` - Minimal dev configuration
- [x] `scripts/setup-database.js` - Database setup automation
- [x] `scripts/check-dependencies.js` - Dependency verification
- [x] Database connection (PostgreSQL) - Script ready
- [x] Redis connection - Optional, handled gracefully
- [x] SMTP configuration - Test config provided
- [x] JWT secrets - Dev secret configured
- [x] API keys - Optional providers

### 3. ~~Database Schema~~ 📊 COMPLETED
**Status**: Ready
**Completed**:
- [x] Database migrations exist (auth-schema.sql)
- [x] Schema setup script created
- [x] Default roles and permissions included
- [x] Connection pooling configured in services
- [x] Setup automation: `npm run db:setup`

### 4. Service Dependencies 🔗
**Need to verify each service**:
- [ ] calculationService - properly initialized
- [ ] scenarioService - database connected
- [ ] authService - Redis connected
- [ ] emailService - SMTP configured
- [ ] reportService - template engine ready

### 5. API Documentation 📖
**Status**: Unknown
**Need**:
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- [ ] Route documentation
- [ ] Authentication flow docs
- [ ] Error handling standards

### 6. Error Handling 🚨
**Need to implement**:
- [ ] Global error handler
- [ ] Graceful shutdown
- [ ] Circuit breakers for external services
- [ ] Proper logging levels

### 7. Security 🔒
**Critical checks**:
- [ ] Input validation on all routes
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] CORS properly set
- [ ] Helmet.js configured

### 8. Performance 🚀
**Optimization needed**:
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Caching strategy
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Memory leak prevention

### 9. Monitoring 📊
**Infrastructure**:
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Metrics collection
- [ ] Log aggregation
- [ ] Alert thresholds

### 10. Deployment 🚢
**Production readiness**:
- [ ] Docker configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Environment separation
- [ ] Rollback strategy

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Fix the failing test** - This is blocking everything
2. **Create proper .env.example** - Document all required variables
3. **Verify database connection** - Ensure we can connect
4. **Run full test suite** - All tests must pass
5. **Create integration tests** - Test service interactions

## Remember: NO RUSHING! 
Each step must be verified before moving to the next.
