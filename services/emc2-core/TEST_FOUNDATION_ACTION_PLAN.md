# 🌂 Mary Poppins' Test Foundation Action Plan

## Current State Summary
✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Zero TypeScript Errors!
- Build is now successful
- All TypeScript compilation errors fixed
- Project can be built without issues

## Phase 2: Test Foundation (In Progress)

### Test Suite Status
- ✅ 5 test suites passing
- ❌ 2 test suites failing (security.test.ts, services.integration.test.ts)
- 📊 Coverage: ~6.85% (ABYSMAL!)

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. Fix Failing Tests (Today)
- [ ] Fix security.test.ts - Missing imports/functions
- [ ] Fix services.integration.test.ts - Database connection issues
- [ ] Ensure all test suites run without errors

#### 2. Create Test Infrastructure (Week 1)
```typescript
// Test Database Setup
- [ ] Create test database migrations
- [ ] Implement test data factories
- [ ] Add database cleanup between tests

// Test Utilities
- [ ] Mock factories for all services
- [ ] Test data builders
- [ ] Custom assertions
- [ ] Integration test harness
```

#### 3. Service Test Coverage (Week 2)
Priority order based on criticality:

1. **authService.ts** (Current: ~71%)
   - [ ] Add tests for edge cases
   - [ ] Test error scenarios
   - [ ] Test session management
   - [ ] Test password reset flow

2. **calculationService.ts** (Current: Low)
   - [ ] Test all calculation methods
   - [ ] Test boundary conditions
   - [ ] Test invalid inputs
   - [ ] Performance tests

3. **scenarioService.ts** (Current: Low)
   - [ ] CRUD operations
   - [ ] Validation tests
   - [ ] Permission tests
   - [ ] Concurrent access tests

4. **taskQueueService.ts** (Current: 0%)
   - [ ] Queue operations
   - [ ] Job processing
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Retry logic

#### 4. API Route Tests (Week 3)
- [ ] Health endpoints (100% coverage)
- [ ] Auth endpoints (100% coverage)
- [ ] Scenario endpoints
- [ ] Calculation endpoints
- [ ] Error handling

#### 5. Integration Tests (Week 3)
- [ ] Auth flow integration
- [ ] Scenario workflow
- [ ] Email service integration
- [ ] Database transactions
- [ ] Redis caching

## Test Writing Guidelines

### Unit Test Template
```typescript
describe('ServiceName', () => {
  let service: ServiceName;
  let mockDependency: jest.Mocked<Dependency>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockDependency = createMockDependency();
    service = new ServiceName(mockDependency);
  });

  describe('methodName', () => {
    it('should handle happy path', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = TestDataBuilder.buildInput();
      mockDependency.someMethod.mockResolvedValue(expectedValue);

      // Act
      const result = await service.methodName(input);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toMatchObject(expectedShape);
      expect(mockDependency.someMethod).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expectedParams);
    });

    it('should handle error case', async () => {
      // Test error scenarios
    });
  });
});
```

### Integration Test Template
```typescript
describe('Feature Integration', () => {
  let app: any;
  let db: Pool;
  let redis: Redis;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    ({ app, db, redis } = await setupTestEnvironment());
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await cleanupTestEnvironment({ app, db, redis });
  });

  it('should complete end-to-end flow', async () => {
    // Test complete user journey
  });
});
```

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goals
- [ ] All tests passing (0 failures)
- [ ] Test infrastructure complete
- [ ] Coverage > 20%

### Week 2 Goals
- [ ] Core services tested
- [ ] Coverage > 50%
- [ ] All critical paths covered

### Week 3 Goals
- [ ] Integration tests complete
- [ ] Coverage > 80%
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline enforcing coverage

### Week 4 Goals
- [ ] Coverage > 90%
- [ ] Performance tests added
- [ ] Mutation testing implemented
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Quality Gates

1. **Pre-commit Hook**
   ```bash
   npm run test:changed
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

2. **Pre-push Hook**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run build
   ```

3. **CI Pipeline**
   - Build must pass
   - All tests must pass
   - Coverage must not decrease
   - No new TypeScript errors

## The Mary Poppins Promise

"A spoonful of testing helps the features go down!"

We will NOT add any new features until:
1. ✅ All tests are passing
2. ✅ Coverage is above 80%
3. ✅ Quality gates are in place
4. ✅ Team is following TDD

Remember: **Quality over Quantity, Foundation over Features!**
