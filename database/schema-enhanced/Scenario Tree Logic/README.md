# Scenario Tree Logic Implementation

This folder contains the complete implementation of the Scenario Tree system for Mortgage Broker Pro 2.0.

## Overview

The Scenario Tree is a sophisticated, event-sourced question flow management system designed specifically for the mortgage industry. It handles dynamic questionnaires, multi-lender requirements, and complex conditional logic while maintaining perfect audit trails.

## Installation

1. Ensure PostgreSQL 14+ is installed
2. Install required extensions:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS fuzzystrmatch;
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gist;
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
   ```

3. Execute files in order:
   ```bash
   psql -d your_database -f ScenarioTree-Core-Logic-v3.0-FINAL.sql
   psql -d your_database -f ScenarioTree-Production-Enhancements-v1.0.sql
   psql -d your_database -f ScenarioTree-Similarity-Detection-v1.0.sql
   psql -d your_database -f ScenarioTree-Foundation-Enhancements.sql
   psql -d your_database -f ScenarioTree-Full-Feature-Enhancements.sql
   ```

4. Run health checks from `00-ScenarioTree-Master-Implementation.sql`

## Maintenance

See the maintenance schedule in `00-ScenarioTree-Master-Implementation.sql` for:
- Daily tasks (VACUUM, refresh views)
- Weekly tasks (cleanup, similarity detection)
- Monthly tasks (archive events)

## Integration Points

The Scenario Tree integrates with:
- **Athena Evaluation Engine** - For complex rule evaluation
- **EMCÂ² Schema** - For domain model integration
- **Hermes Import System** - For data ingestion
- **External Systems** - Via the integration framework

## Support

For questions or issues, refer to:
- Architecture decisions document for design rationale
- Individual SQL files for detailed comments
- Health check queries for diagnostics
